        I'm a 23 y/o passionate developer. I love building things and solving
        problems. I've completed a 6-month front-end course at Step Academy
        where I learned Angular, and I've also studied Node.js and Express,
        mastering the creation of REST APIs. I enjoy language design, web
        development. If I'm not coding, I'm probably Working Out, or watching
        movies. P.S My Projects Might have initial Cold Start about 20-30s.
