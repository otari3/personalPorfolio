  I successfully secured financing for the PCAP (Python Certified Associate
  <br />
  Programmer) exam after passing the internal assessments of the "Do It in
  <br />
  Georgia" government projectâ€”an international certification training program
  <br />
  that selected only 1,000 participants from 15,000 applicants. I went on to
  <br />
  pass the PCAP exam with a score of 80%. confirmation
